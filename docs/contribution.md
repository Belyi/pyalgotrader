We welcome anyone to contribute codevn.py。  
If you want to contribute code to usegithubofPR(Pull Request)Process。

PRProcess is as follows：

1. [create Issue][CreateIssue] - For larger changes(As new features，Large-scale reconstruction, etc.)A good idea to openissueDiscuss， smallerimprovement(Such as documentation improvements，bugfixWait)Sent directlyPRTo

2. Fork [vn.py][#GithubVnpy] - Click on the top right**Fork**Push button

3. CloneYour ownfork: ```git clone https://github.com/$userid/vnpy.git```

Creating EndPRPlease be patient after：Once we have free will checkPR，Once your code is useful and[Meet the requirements](#Code style)，It will be consolidated！

## Code style
For thevn.pyWrite the code，We need to follow some basic rules，Otherwise your code may not bemerge。
These rules include：
1. [Naming Rules](#Naming Rules)
2. [Code format](#Code format)
3. [Check the code quality](#Check the code quality)


### Naming Rules
Naming our code is as follows：

* Class Properties、Class Methods、Parameters and variables in the form of lower case underlined
* Class names using camel named
* Constant use of forms of capital underlined

E.g：
```python
DEFAULT_PATH = "/tmp/vn.py/"
class ClassA:
    def __init__(self, arg_one: int, arg_two: str):
        if arg_two is None:
            arg_two = DEFAULT_PATH
        self.property_one = arg_one
        variable_one = "some string"
```


### Code format
We do not have particularly stringent requirements of the code format，But at least in line withpep8standard，And additionally in classes and to bring all the following functionsdocstring(That is, a period of"""""")。

To make compliance with the codepep8standard，After writing the code to use[autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8)Formatting your code on it:  
```bash
autopep8 --in-place --recursive . 
```

### Check the code quality
use[flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)Check your code，Ensure that noerrorwithwarning。
Run in the project root directory```flake8```You can check out the local code is not written in a rigorous。If you check outerrororwarning，The code that you need to make some changes to improve quality。
